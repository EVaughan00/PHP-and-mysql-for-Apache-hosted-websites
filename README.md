# PHP-and-mysql-for-Apache-hosted-websites

# I am running this in kali linux where most of the necessary tools are pre installed
# for other distros apache2, php, and mysql need to be installed and started.
# The mysql database needs to be initialized with some tables and, with this version, needs to have data preset into a created table.
# This is a very basic model of databasing from a website.
